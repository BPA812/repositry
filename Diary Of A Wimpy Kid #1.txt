Tuesday
First of all, let me get something straight: This
is a JOURNAL, not a diary. I know what it
says on the cover, but when Mum went out to
buy this thing I SPECIFICALLY told her to
get one that didn't say 'diary' on it.

Great. All I need is for some jerk to catch me 
carrying this book around and get the wrong idea.

Bully:Sissy!

The other thing I want to clear up right away
is that this was MUM's idea, not mine.

But if she thinks I'm going to write down my
'feelings' in here or whatever, she's crazy. So
just don't expect me to be all 'Dear Diary' this
and 'Dear Diary that.

The only reason I agreed to do this at all is
because I figure later on when I'm rich and
famous, I'll have better things to do than
answer people's stupid questions all day long. SO
this book is gonna come in handy.

Fan 1:Gregory!
      Tell us
      about
      your
      childhood!

Fan 2:Were you
      ALWAYS
      so smart
      and
      handsome?
      
Like I said, I'll be famous one day, but for now
I'm stuck in high school with a bunch of morons.

Let me say for the record that I think
high school is the dumbest idea ever invented.
You got kids like me who haven't hit their growth
spurt yet mixed in with these gorillas who need
to shave twice a day.

Bully:Outta my way, runts!

And then they wonder why bullying is such a big 
problem.

If it was up to me, grade levels would be based
on height, not age. But then again, I guess
that would mean kids like Chirag Gupta would
still be in the first grade.

Today is the first day of school, and right now
we're just waiting around for the teacher to hurry
up and finish th seating chart. So I figured I
might as well write in this book to pass the time.

By the way, let me give you some good advice. On
the first day of school, you got to be real care-
ful where you si. You walk into the classroom and
just plonk your stuff down on any old desk and
the next thing you know the teacher is saying-

Teacher:I hope you all like
        where you're sitting, 
        because these are your
        permanent seats.
        
Greg:Gaah!

So in this class, I got stuck with Chris Hosey in 
front of me and Lionel James in back of me.

Jason Brill came in late and almost sat to my
right, but luckily I stopped that from happening
at the last second.

Jason Brill:Is this
            seat
            taken?
           
Greg:Yes!
     Yes!
