Tuesday
First of all, let me get something straight: This
is a JOURNAL, not a diary. I know what it
says on the cover, but when Mum went out to
buy this thing I SPECIFICALLY told her to
get one that didn't say 'diary' on it.

Great. All I need is for some jerk to catch me 
carrying this book around and get the wrong idea.

The other thing I want to clear up right away
is that this was MUM's idea, not mine.

But if she thinks I'm going to write down my
'feelings' in here or whatever, she's crazy. So
just don't expect me to be all 'Dear Diary' this
and 'Dear Diary that.

The only reason I agreed to do this at all is
because I figure later on when I'm rich and
famous, I'll have better things to do than
answer people's stupid questions all day long. SO
this book is gonna come in handy.

Like I said, I'll be famous one day, but for now
I'm stuck in high school with a bunch of morons.

Let me say for the record that I think
high school is the dumbest idea ever invented.
You got kids like me who haven't hit their growth
spurt yet mixed in with these gorillas who need
to shave twice a day.

And then they wonder why bullying is such
